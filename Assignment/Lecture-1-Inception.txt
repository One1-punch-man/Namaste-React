Q. async vs defer attributes
Answer:-  Here async and defer are the attributes of script tag in html.
a) <script src="">
When we write above syntax the Html parser runs until it encounters script tag then fetches the scripts from the network 
then executes it then continues parsing.
b) <script async src="">
when we write above syntax html parser runs and also parallaly fetches the script from network, 
when encounters the script tag executes it then continue pasing html.
c)<script defer src="">
when we use above syntax html parser runs, fetches script from network parallay, complete the parsing then executes the fetched script.

The key difference between async and defer is async does not maintain order of execution but defer does it.
when we have dependecy of one script tag on anoher we should not use async, defer is preferable.
